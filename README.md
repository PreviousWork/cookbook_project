# MyCookbook

My 2nd major project for Ironhack

A recipe journal for people who want to learn how to cook. 
The app is mobile responsive and if you take pictures with 
your phone, please turn it sideways.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, MongoDB, and Cloudinary.

The site may change later on as I get better with CRUD functions and
I'll probably use Angular2 or React.
